Output will be written into the directory: /home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/WGBS/3.bismark_deduplicate/sample2/
Processing paired-end Bismark output file(s) (SAM format):
/home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/WGBS/2.bismark_align/sample2/sample2_1_trimmed_bismark_bt2_pe.bam


If there are several alignments to a single position in the genome the first alignment will be chosen. Since the input files are not in any way sorted this is a near-enough random selection of reads.

Checking file >>/home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/WGBS/2.bismark_align/sample2/sample2_1_trimmed_bismark_bt2_pe.bam<< for signs of file truncation...

### File appears to be empty, terminating deduplication process. Please make sure the input file has not been truncated. ###
