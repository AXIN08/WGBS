Output will be written into the directory: /home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/WGBS/3.bismark_deduplicate/sample1/
Processing paired-end Bismark output file(s) (SAM format):

If there are several alignments to a single position in the genome the first alignment will be chosen. Since the input files are not in any way sorted this is a near-enough random selection of reads.
