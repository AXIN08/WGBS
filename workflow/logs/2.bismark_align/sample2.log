Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.5.1])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/home/liuxin/mambaforge/envs/snakemake/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is /home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/CHM13_ref/	(absolute path is '/home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/CHM13_ref/)'
