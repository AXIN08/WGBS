Bismark report for: /home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/WGBS/1.trimmed/sample1/sample1_1_trimmed.fq.gz and /home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/WGBS/1.trimmed/sample1/sample1_2_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.24.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/liuxin/data_pasteur/12_epigenome/CHM13_ref/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	1729
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	1346
Mapping efficiency:	77.8% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	288
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	95
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	661	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	685	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
